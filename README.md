## SWTOR Extracting, Modding and Datamining

We are a group of swtor fans who enjoy messing with the game, and pulling out models, textures, etc. This repo contains tools and guides to help you do so yourself, as well as some other things

### To learn about the usage of the tools available in this GitHub, please access our **[WikiPedia](https://github.com/SWTOR-Extractors-Modders-Dataminers/WikiPedia/wiki)**.

For more information, we suggest you to join Xentax' forum's **[SWTOR thread](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7186&start=99999)**, which holds almost all the research done since the pre-release of Star Wars: The Old Republic in August 2011 (also present up to date in the site's permanent sections).

Also, we encourage you to join our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/XfHFjSN)**, where you will be able to interact with fellow hobbyists in a more immediate manner and find help if you get stuck.
